## General information
For the delivery of laboratory work you need to have:
  - a report that includes the source code of your laboratory work;
  - commited source code on your repository of github (each laboratory work, that student do, should be committed to his repository with the message like: "done lab 1");
  - you also need to answer all the questions that will be asked. 

Questions for laboratory work are given below, but they are approximate. During the delivery of the laboratory work, everything that you did in it  will be asked and all the details of your code will be disassembled.
